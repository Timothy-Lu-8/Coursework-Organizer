This Discord Bot uses the Nextcord API and an SQLite Database to keep track of important dates in the semester such as homework due dates and exam dates.
I really just made this because I don't really like to use calendars or planners, and since I use Discord more than both of these combined by a significant amount, I figured I'd make this bot.
There are currently five available query types:
-adding an assignment
-removing an assignment
-viewing all important dates
-viewing important dates within the next week
-updating completion status of an assignment
